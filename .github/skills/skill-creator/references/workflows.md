# Workflow Patterns

## Sequential Workflows

Break operations into clear sequential steps. Example:

1. Analyze input
2. Prepare mapping
3. Validate
4. Execute
5. Verify output

## Conditional Workflows

For branching logic, guide Claude through decision points and present the appropriate sub-workflow.
